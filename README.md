# AI MIDI Music Generator

To start, our project sought to utilize musical features (such as tempo, key signature, and note density) to create a machine learning model that is able to accurate generate new MIDI music.  Thus, our problem statement is: Given the distribution of defining musical features (such as tempo, key signature, and note density) within music, how are we able to craft a machine-learning model that accurately generates new MIDI music? We decided to use the Lakh dataset (https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) because it had a wider range of musical genres and artists the model could train on compared to the Maestro dataset. Based on our thorough exploration of the data, with more information on this below, our revised project question remains generally consistent. However, as our training datasets are primarily encompassed with $\texttt{pop}$ genre music, we seek to answer said question, but in the context of $\texttt{pop}$ .
