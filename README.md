# AI MIDI Music Generator

To start, our project sought to utilize musical features (such as tempo, key signature, and note density) to create a machine learning model that is able to accurate generate new MIDI music.

Given the distribution of defining musical features (such as tempo, key signature, and note density) within music, how are we able to craft a machine-learning model that accurately generates new MIDI music? 

The Lakh dataset was used for this project (https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) because it had a wider range of musical genres and artists the model could train on compared to the Maestro dataset.
